# Generate Images Automatically


A project that uses koa framework and openai library to generate images automatically.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to use natural language processing technology to generate images automatically. We use the dall-e model from the openai library, which can generate corresponding images based on text descriptions. For example, when the user inputs "a cat sitting on a sofa", the system will automatically generate an image of a cat sitting on a sofa.

## Features

- Implemented a simple HTTP server using the koa framework to provide a RESTful API for image generation.
- Provided a front-end page for users to input descriptions and generate images.
- Used CSS and JavaScript animation effects to beautify the front-end page.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

First, install the Node.js environment. Then, run the following command in the project root directory to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Configuration

Before using the openai library, you need to register an account on the openai website and obtain an API key.

Enter the obtained API key in the server.js file:

```js
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");

const configuration = new Configuration({
apiKey: "your API key",
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
```

### Running

Run the following command in the project root directory to start the project:

```
npm start
```

After the project starts, you can use the project by visiting http://localhost:3000 in a browser.

## Example

Assuming that you have started the project and visited http://localhost:3000 in a browser, you will see a screen similar to the following:
